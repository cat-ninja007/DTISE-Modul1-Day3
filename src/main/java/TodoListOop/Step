- Create Entity
    => Entity is the representation of data
    => To create a class that used to be the representation of data we need to provide the getter and setter
    => getter to get the data
    => setter to set the data
    => create constructor

- Use Case / Bussiness Logic / Service
    To create Service Layer & Repository Layer we need to create Interface firstly, after the we do Class Implementation
    => Create Repository for Interface
    => Create Interface
        ==> Usually, the name of the interface is same as the name of entity
        ==> In this interface we will create the methods that we will use
        ``` THE BUSINESS LOGIC```
        1. Show Todo List
        2. Input Todo List
        3. Remove Todo List

    => Create Service
        ==> Create repository for Service
        ==> Create Interface
            ==> In this interface, we followed the amount of bussines logic method. In this case 3 methods, so we create 3 as well.

    => Create View
       ==> Create repository for View
       ==> Create Class
            ==> In this class, we follow the amount of business logic methods. In this case 3, so we create 3.

- Implementation
    => Repository & Service : Show Todo List
